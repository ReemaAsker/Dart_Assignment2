# Dart Programming Tasks

---

## Question 1

### ✅ Write a Dart program that:

- Reads two numbers (**assign directly** for simplicity).
- Checks if **either is odd and the other is even**, or **both are positive** (using `&&`, `||`).
- Uses `++` and `--` to increment the first and decrement the second.
- Casts one result to an integer using `.toInt()`.
- Applies the bitwise NOT `~` to the first number **after casting**.
- Prints `true` if the incremented first number is **greater than** the decremented second, using a **conditional operator (`? :`)**.

---

## Question 2

### ✅ Write a Dart function that:

- Takes a **double** number (e.g., `num = 12.7`).
- Prints the **ceiling**, **floor**, and **rounded** values.
- Concatenates the number as a **string** with a given name (e.g., `"Value: 12.7"`).
- Uses the conditional operator `? :` to print:
  - `"Large"` if the number is above `10`
  - `"Small"` otherwise.

---

## Question 3

### ✅ Write Dart code that:

- Declares a **constant list** `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`.
- Converts the list to a **set** and **adds the value `12`**.
- Creates a **map** where:
  - Keys are from the **set**
  - Values are the numbers **multiplied by 3**
- Prints the **map**.

---

## Question 4

### ✅ Write a Dart program that:

- Reads a **number of days**.
- Converts days to:
  - **Years** (`1 year = 365 days`)
  - **Months** (`1 month = 30 days`)
  - Remaining **days**
- Prints all results.

#### Sample Output:

```
400 days => Years: 1, Months: 1, Days: 5
```
